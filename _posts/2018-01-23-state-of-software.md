I have the good fortune to work with top companies whose leaders are passionate about transforming their applications and technologies to improve the quality and responsiveness of their business users to enhance the experience of their customers.

What is the point of technology if it does not make life simpler, the journey smoother and faster for delivering services to customers in a reliable way? So why is it so common for top companies to invest so much resource and budget to consistently fail at such a simple objective?

The sad truth is that every project I join after the fact will be facing the daunting reality of missing it’s key objectives of budget, timescale and almost always compromise on quality. The reasons for such issues are always very obvious to me and can be usually attributed to poor leadership, lack of a disciplined methodology and supporting detailed plan. Poor teamwork and politics across silo departments and third party suppliers who are not managed to an appropriate commercial framework can also exacerbate the challenge.

In very rare cases where I have been entrusted by project sponsors to initiate a project from concept through to completion have I had a genuine sense of fulfilling a promise to deliver a project on time, under budget and exceeding customer expectations. Handing over a project and witnessing a rapid adoption by customers is without doubt the final seal of validation. It’s an amazing feeling for all concerned!
 
The challenge with many enterprises is that the stakeholders and senior leadership are complex and highly political in nature spanning across many departments. The scale of investment required to deliver transformational change has to be justified on the scale of impact and as result the project leader is faced with walking a political tightrope. The need to constantly justify and seek approval is counter-productive. This interference coupled with the resulting confusion places commercial and people dependencies under immense strain that paralyses the project team from achieving the simplest milestones. 

That aside, many project teams simply do not understand or follow a formal software development process. The common theme I encounter on my project engagements is the lack of traceability, requirements and design artifacts. Most project teams are clueless as to what has been implemented and the traceability from implemented code back to test case, design, architecture assumptions, requirements and business case. This lack of traceability and discipline often means that the developer responsible for writing the code is the most important person in the project as they must make sense and deliver working software by making best guess assumptions where formal traceable documentation is not available.

Now let’s imagine we have multiple development teams with several developers working on various sub-systems. This will compound the risks and scale of mismatches that will surface during the integration phase of major sub-components. The later we identify and attempt to resolve issues during the project lifecycle the greater the impact on schedule, cost and quality.

Many large organisations have shifted away from a waterfall approach to project delivery to adopt a more iterative, incremental and agile methodology. The benefit of shorter cycle times for delivering drops of functionality has been welcomed by business users as there is a sense of progress and early visibility of project status. Also, dispensing with the formal analysis and design documentation that usually accompanied the waterfall approach was considered a major benefit of agile. My experience of hybrid agile projects has sadly observed ever more budget and schedule over runs resulting in sub standard legacy software being delivered from the outset. 

As projects approach a looming year end and end of budget, I see frantic efforts to identify a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to enable the project to be shut down as quickly as possible to avoid the unwelcome request by senior managers for additional funding and time to bring the project back on track. Naturally, these efforts are highly disruptive and demoralising for all concerned. Very rarely can such a project recover or deliver on its original business case and promise. Usually, the major transformational project has already become a legacy system of Frankenstein proportions.

Why do most organisations get it so badly wrong? This is always due to weak leadership that lacks the experience and capability to scope, analyse and plan project. Add to this the hiring of inexperienced or poorly motivated people to key roles that lack the domain or technical expertise, then we have the recipe for a perfect storm. The issues that drive a project to failure isn’t due to the software, tools or technology. It is the lack of experience, sound process model and methodology that profoundly impacts the quality of the build and a robust design that is fit for purpose - capable of withstanding amendment without falling apart at the first attempt at a change.

Very few projects proceed as planned. The start of a project is announced with great fanfare and enthusiasm but rapidly hit a wall as productivity waivers off course. The rush to get something delivered results in chaos. The pressure to succeed means that a deliverable will be hobbled together with an acceptable list of inaccuracies and defects. *Not to worry, the project will learn from past mistakes and deliver better next time*. Unfortunately, like suicidal lemmings we rush to the next cliff repeating the same mistakes over and over again.

Please contact me if you have a requirement for an experienced technical delivery manager to help you stem the tide of challenges and issues your technology projects are facing. Project management is not simply about managing lists and raid logs. An experienced hands on technical delivery manager will engender trust, clear objectives and responsibilities across your technology and business teams. Adopting a traceable project methodology will help your business stakeholders deliver an exceptional user experience for your customers.
