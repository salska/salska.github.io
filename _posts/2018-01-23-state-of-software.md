I have the good fortune to work with top companies and teams of people who are passionate about transforming their applications and business processes with new  technologies, services and infrastructure. I have gained and learnt so much during my consultancy engagements and no two projects have ever been similar. There has always been a common theme and reality faced by all large project teams and that is the calibre of the people and also the professionalism and discipline followed in delivering key objectives. Sadly the larger the team size the greater the complexity and variability of outcomes.
 
The state of software development and the shape of many projects is in a predictably sorry state. The appetite for agile delivery is a formula for projects to continue to burn budget and absorb resources to add to insatiable list of essential functionality that will unlikely deliver major business benefits. 

Please contact me if you have a requirement for a consistent and trusted digital service where citizens or customers can be sure that the services that they are accessing are bona fide websites and not the latest phishing scam to entice innocent people to share confidential details or financial information to unscrupulous cyber criminals.
