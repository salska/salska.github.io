When you take a monolithic application and package it as a microservice that requires 64G of RAM - that is not a microservice!

When a full end to end test of your microservice requires 4 cycles of testing over a period of 6 months - that is not a microservice! 

When the volume of test defects generated by your new microservice is an order of magnitude greater than the original business requirements - that is not a microservice! 

What if all of the above were true? 

Let's add to this the all too common "we are agile but also waterfall" when it comes to delivery and our route into production requires a minimum of 12 weeks governance red tape. 

We also have no strategy, end to end design or meaningful business case. 

Would you be surprised to learn that the new system being delivered is comatose before a single user or transaction can be processed? 

How could we end up producing a system that is more complex, inflexible and expensive than the original over-priced managed service that has been crippling the business for the last 10 years.
