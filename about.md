```
hello world!
```

My name is Sal Kabay and I'm based in Edinburgh. I own eMetrix Consulting which I use to offer management consultancy services to my clients.

I have a PhD in Engineering and enjoy applying technology to solve business problems. 

When I'm not working on a big client based project, I am busy catching up with the amazing advances that have been made with software, systems and technology.

I am currently focused on small scale iOS / OSX development using Xcode / Swift 3. Also, I'm putting into practise some DevOps CI/CD techniques to get a thorough understanding of the available technologies and challenges. 

I have worked for many large and small companies all over the world, have many patents and published journal articles and scientific papers. 

I'm also a keen runner who tries to average 20 miles each week. I occassionaly run races at 10k and Half Marathon distance.
