```
    Loyalty and trust!
```

Today, we are feeling the pain and grief of losing a loyal and trusted family friend. **Pepe!** The trust and bond that we had built with this timid and yet independent garden predator was remarkable. Would you be surprised to learn that I am talking about the cat pictured below - ***Pepe happily sandwiched between my Mac and lap whilst I worked away.***

Pepe was a loyal, devoted and gentle friend. We are missing him and he has left us with so many memories. We all appreciate that dogs are known for their loyalty. Many will find it difficult to understand how a cat could be considered as loyal. There is no doubt that cats can be loyal. Cat's mirror the behaviour of their owners. If offered love, they will respond. If ignored, or worse, mistreated, they will avoid contact.

Getting loyalty from a cat requires giving it first. If we give a cat affection and showing an interest in them, the cat will naturally want to spend time in our company. They will seek us out to give us attention. They will hang out nearby because they want to look at us.

Pepe used to follow us from room to room and when he was left out of a room because of a closed door, he would leap up and pull the door handle down to let himself in. Pepe also understood simple instructions and would never jump on or sleep on a sofa or bed. Disciplined! 

Pepe sadly passed away today and we will miss making a fuss over him and watching his crazy antics. Sleeping only at specific spots around the house proved he also had OCD tendencies! Farewell old friend, you will be missed.
